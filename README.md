Google Maps and or Open Steetmap data (using free Mapquest API).

Basic script to calcualte best route between set of address variables:

Google developer docs: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/

Open Data (MapQuest) docs: http://open.mapquestapi.com/directions/


* Open Data is free to use with no limits, using Foogle limits you to a very small amount
of waypoints, works perfectly using Open Data, I myself use this in production for a delivery
route planning script for a logistics company that delivers thoughout the United Kingdom.
